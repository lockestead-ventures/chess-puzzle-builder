# Chess Puzzle Builder Roadmap

## âœ… Accomplished
- Reliable puzzle generation from chess.com and lichess games
- Stockfish integration (basic, with fallback heuristics)
- ASCII/monospace UI and progress bar
- Sophisticated frontend progress animation (frontend-only delays)
- Puzzle solving interface with:
  - Solution reveal after 5 failed attempts
  - Hint system (highlight piece after 1 failed attempt)
  - Star rating system for puzzle performance
- Error handling for Chess960 and API failures
- Removal of backend artificial delays (all perceived delay is frontend-only)
- Removal of "Show Solution" button until user has failed enough times
- Removal of staggered puzzle loading for reliability

## ðŸš§ In Progress
- Local storage of completed puzzles and star ratings (per user, frontend only for now)
- Displaying user ELO on puzzle summary (fetch from chess.com/lichess)
- Backend: Remove all deprecated chess.com API calls and ensure only PGN-based puzzle generation
- Fix and robustly implement the "How this was played" feature on the puzzle solver page, including:
  - Always animating the move from the correct FEN
  - Handling edge cases where the move is not valid from the expected position
  - Improving error handling and user feedback
  - Re-enabling the button once the feature is stable

## ðŸ•’ Planned / Backlog
### User & Progress Tracking
- User accounts (sign up, login, persistent progress)
- Backend storage of puzzle results, star ratings, and user progress
- Analytics section for user improvement (dashboard)
- Notification system for milestones/achievements
- Local storage fallback for guest users

### ELO Analytics
- ELO analytics dashboard:
  - Import historical ELO from chess.com/lichess on signup
  - Track ELO over time and visualize progress (line graph)
  - Correlate puzzle activity with ELO improvement
  - Show ELO at signup vs. current ELO
  - Notify users of ELO milestones

### Puzzle Generation & Solving
- Advanced puzzle generation:
  - Deeper Stockfish analysis
  - More puzzle themes (forks, pins, mates, etc.)
  - Support for more game types (Chess960, variants)
- Puzzle difficulty calibration based on user ELO
- Option to skip or flag puzzles as "bad" or "uninteresting"
- Puzzle explanations: auto-generate or allow user/community submissions
- Mobile/responsive UI improvements

### UI/UX & Polish
- Analytics/progress dashboard (stars, streaks, solved count, etc.)
- Improved error messages and user feedback
- Accessibility improvements (keyboard navigation, ARIA labels)
- Launch checklist and polish (favicon, meta tags, SEO, etc.)
- About/help page and onboarding flow
- Social sharing of puzzles/achievements
- Admin tools for managing puzzles and users
